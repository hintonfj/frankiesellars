    <h2>Philosophy</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">As your teacher, I am here to assist you in reaching your musical goals. Whether that is learning a new hobby, playing in school orchestra, or taking regional and state auditions, I will guide you to improve your technique, learn new music, and learn how to practice on your own. I embrace neurodivergence and various physical abilities, and prioritize joy in every lesson, no matter your age or level. Lastly, I encourage curiosity – no question is too big to be explored!</p>

        <p><em>"We truly believe that Frankie was instrumental in our son continuing to play the bass through the pandemic and beyond. Four years later, he is still playing bass for his high school orchestra and we owe a lot to Frankie. Frankie was always organized, well prepared and taught our son online as well as in person. They always arrived on time and made the most of the lesson. Frankie is also an incredible bass player and we enjoyed listening to them perform at an online recital they arranged. We highly recommend Frankie as a bass teacher."</em></p>
